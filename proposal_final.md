1) Find out number of observatoins and columns


2) Column data types


3) Check for number of unique categories for categorical variables


4) Check for missing values


5) Identify potential features for machine learning (some columns may not have predictive power)


6) Identify the target column 



7) Look at the distribution of the target columns. for categorical type, find out if it is imblanced. For numeric type, see how it is distributed  (summary statistics, boxplot, histogram).
