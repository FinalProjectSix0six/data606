## What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?

Given today's competition within the market, it is critical to understand the different behaviors, types, and interests of customers. Especially in targeted marketing, understanding and categorizing customers is an essential step in forming effective marketing strategies. By segmenting the customer base, marketers can focus on one segment of customers at a time. It also helps marketers to tailor their marketing messages to one specific audience at a time. Customer segmentation is the backbone of successful targeted marketing, with which you can target specific groups of customers with different pricing options, promotions, and product placements that capture the interests of the target audience in the most cost-effective way.





## Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

I work with customer segmentation models at work. however other business or industry'scan benefit from a better understanding of different customer segments. For example, television advertisements that are broadcast across all over the USA for an outerwear brand that sells winter clothes, such as parkas, snow boots, and hats, would not be so cost-effective. People residing in areas that never really get cold, such as Florida, Southern California, or Hawaii, would most likely not be interested in purchasing winter clothes.


## What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?

Can we use customer segmentation to predict long term customer value?

## Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?

The dataset is from IBM originally. However data was made public through open source on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pankajjsh06/ibm-watson-marketing-customer-value-data 


## What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?

CLV- customer lifetime value. 


## What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?

I will be using continuous variables. This is required when completing K-means clustering algorithem.



## What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?

K-means Clustering to gather customer information and split them into different clustering groups to determine which group is most valuable and what characteristics they all have in common.


## How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?


I will use the Elbow method in order to integrate my findings and compare the results, and based on domain knowledge and further research, and work experience I will determine whether I have selected the correct k-value.


## What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?


Improve understanding of unsupervised learning using K-means clustering, and improve customer segmentation skills.
